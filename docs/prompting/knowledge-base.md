## Document 1: Shoplite User Registration and Account Management

To create a Shoplite account, users begin at the registration page where they are asked to provide their full name, email address, and a secure password. Passwords must include a minimum of eight characters with at least one number and one special character to meet platform security standards. After submitting this information, users receive an email verification link that must be confirmed within 24 hours to activate the account.

Shoplite offers two primary account types: **buyer accounts** and **seller accounts**. Buyer accounts are free and designed for customers who want to browse products, add items to their shopping cart, and complete purchases. Seller accounts, on the other hand, require additional steps, including business verification and submission of tax identification details. The seller onboarding process usually takes between two and three business days, after which sellers gain access to inventory tools, commission dashboards, and customer support channels.

Once registered, users can manage their account through the **Account Settings** dashboard. This area allows them to update personal details, reset passwords, configure two-factor authentication, and manage payment methods. Notification preferences, such as receiving order updates by email or push alerts from the mobile app, can also be customized here. For seller accounts, the dashboard includes options to add new products, track sales, and review performance metrics.

Shoplite places strong emphasis on **account security**. All sensitive data is encrypted, and the platform provides automatic alerts if suspicious activity is detected. Users are encouraged to regularly update their credentials and review login history. For added protection, seller accounts may be required to submit periodic identity checks when unusual activity is flagged.

If users encounter difficulties during registration or login, the **customer support team** is available via live chat, email, or the help center. Detailed FAQs and troubleshooting guides are provided to resolve common issues such as forgotten passwords, expired verification links, or incomplete seller documentation. By following these procedures, Shoplite ensures that both buyers and sellers have a smooth, secure, and reliable entry point into the platform.

## Document 2: Shoplite Product Search and Filtering Features

Shoplite’s product search engine is designed to help users quickly locate items from thousands of sellers across the platform. At the top of every page, a universal search bar allows customers to type in keywords, product names, or brand terms. Search queries are processed in real time, returning results that match product titles, descriptions, and relevant metadata. To improve accuracy, Shoplite also implements auto-suggestions, spelling corrections, and trending searches that guide users toward popular or closely related items.

Beyond the main search bar, Shoplite provides a comprehensive set of **filtering tools** that allow customers to refine their results. Filters are displayed on the left-hand side of the results page and include categories such as price range, seller rating, product condition (new or used), delivery time, and location. For example, a customer searching for a laptop can narrow results by selecting a price bracket, choosing only verified sellers, and filtering for devices eligible for express delivery. These options are designed to reduce browsing time and help buyers focus on products that meet their exact needs.

The **sorting feature** complements filtering by letting users organize results based on relevance, lowest or highest price, newest arrivals, or top-rated products. Personalized sorting, which learns from past browsing and purchase history, is also available for registered users, improving the likelihood of discovering relevant products.

Shoplite also supports **advanced filtering** for specific categories. For fashion items, users can filter by size, color, and fabric. Electronics filters may include specifications such as memory capacity, processor type, or battery life. Each filter dynamically updates results without requiring the page to reload, ensuring a smooth user experience.

For mobile app users, the search and filtering system is optimized for smaller screens. Voice search is integrated, allowing quick queries using natural language. The system also saves recent searches, enabling users to revisit or refine past queries without starting over.

By combining a powerful search bar, flexible filtering options, and personalized sorting, Shoplite ensures that users can efficiently navigate its large catalog. This system not only improves customer satisfaction but also increases seller visibility by connecting products with the right buyers at the right time.

## Document 3: Shoplite Shopping Cart and Checkout Process

The Shoplite shopping cart is designed to give customers flexibility and control over their purchases. Users can add products from multiple sellers into a single cart, making it possible to complete orders across categories without starting multiple checkouts. Cart items display key details such as price, quantity, seller name, and estimated delivery time. Customers can adjust quantities, remove items, or save products for later. Cart contents are preserved for logged-in users across devices, allowing them to continue shopping seamlessly.

During checkout, Shoplite provides a **step-by-step process** to ensure accuracy and convenience. Customers begin by reviewing their order summary, which includes all selected items, shipping costs, applicable taxes, and promotional discounts. Next, they enter or confirm their shipping address, which can be saved for future purchases. Multiple addresses can be stored under one account, allowing buyers to send gifts or ship to work addresses easily.

Shoplite also offers **delivery options** during checkout, ranging from standard shipping to express or same-day delivery where available. The system automatically calculates delivery charges based on distance, item weight, and seller preferences. Customers can select their preferred option before proceeding to the payment stage.

Before final confirmation, customers are presented with a **comprehensive order review** page. This includes the complete breakdown of costs, delivery details, and chosen payment method. Once confirmed, an order number is generated, and the customer receives both an on-screen confirmation and an email receipt. Orders can then be tracked in real time through the user’s account dashboard.

By combining a clear cart layout with a streamlined checkout process, Shoplite minimizes purchase friction, helping customers move from browsing to order completion quickly and securely.

## Document 4: Shoplite Payment Methods and Security

Shoplite provides a wide variety of payment methods to accommodate different customer preferences and regional availability. Commonly accepted options include credit and debit cards, digital wallets such as PayPal and Apple Pay, and direct bank transfers in supported markets. For mobile users, Shoplite also supports platform-native solutions like Google Pay, ensuring fast and convenient transactions.

Security is a central focus of the payment process. All transactions are protected with **SSL encryption**, and card details are never stored directly on Shoplite servers. Instead, the platform works with certified payment gateways that comply with PCI-DSS standards. For additional safety, Shoplite employs tokenization, which replaces sensitive card data with randomized tokens, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

To prevent fraud, Shoplite uses **multi-layer verification systems**. For example, many transactions require two-factor authentication (2FA), such as entering a code sent to the customer’s phone. Risk monitoring tools also flag unusual activity, such as multiple failed payment attempts or purchases from unexpected locations, prompting temporary holds until verification is completed.

Refunds and chargebacks are handled through the same secure gateways. When a customer requests a refund, the transaction is reversed directly through the original payment method, ensuring transparency and traceability. Processing times vary, but most refunds are completed within 5–7 business days depending on the bank or wallet provider.

For sellers, Shoplite provides an easy-to-use **payout system**. Earnings are collected from completed sales and disbursed on a scheduled basis. Detailed payout statements are available in the seller dashboard, ensuring clarity on commissions, fees, and net earnings.

By offering flexible payment options alongside strict security protocols, Shoplite builds trust with both customers and sellers, creating a safe and reliable shopping environment.

## Document 5: Shoplite Order Tracking and Delivery

Once an order is confirmed, Shoplite provides customers with transparent and detailed tracking features to monitor delivery progress. Each order generates a unique tracking number, accessible through the customer’s account dashboard and included in the confirmation email. By clicking on the tracking number, buyers can view real-time updates on package location, courier details, and estimated delivery time.

Shoplite partners with multiple logistics providers to ensure wide coverage and flexible delivery options. Customers can choose from **standard shipping**, **express delivery**, or even **same-day delivery** in select regions. Delivery costs are automatically calculated based on item weight, seller location, and buyer preferences. During checkout, users are clearly informed of the expected delivery timeframe before confirming their order.

The tracking system provides **status updates** at key points: order processing, shipment pickup, in-transit updates, customs clearance (for international orders), and final delivery. Notifications are sent via email, SMS, or mobile app push alerts to keep customers informed throughout the process. Buyers can also add alternative delivery instructions, such as leaving the package with a neighbor or at a pickup point, when supported by the courier.

Shoplite emphasizes reliability by monitoring courier performance and requiring proof of delivery for high-value items. Customers must acknowledge receipt through a digital signature or OTP confirmation in some cases. If delays occur, buyers are promptly notified with updated timelines and, where applicable, offered compensation such as delivery fee refunds or discount vouchers.

For sellers, order tracking integrates directly with the **seller dashboard**, making it easy to confirm shipments, update customers, and resolve delivery issues. Sellers receive automatic alerts when shipments are delayed, allowing them to proactively address concerns with buyers.

By combining flexible delivery options, real-time tracking, and proactive communication, Shoplite ensures that customers enjoy a reliable and transparent order fulfillment experience.

## Document 6: Shoplite Return and Refund Policies

Shoplite’s return and refund system is designed to protect customers while ensuring fairness to sellers. Buyers may return most items within a **30-day window** from the date of delivery, provided the products are in their original condition with packaging, accessories, and proof of purchase. Exceptions apply to perishable goods, digital downloads, and items explicitly marked as non-returnable at checkout.

To begin a return, customers log into their Shoplite account and navigate to the **Order History** section. From there, they select the relevant order, click “Request Return,” and specify a reason such as damaged product, incorrect item, or quality dissatisfaction. The system generates a **return authorization number (RMA)** and provides instructions for packaging and courier pickup or drop-off at an approved return center.

Once the item reaches the seller or designated warehouse, an inspection is performed. If approved, refunds are processed through the original payment method within **5–7 business days**. Partial refunds may apply if items are missing parts or show signs of misuse. For replacement requests, Shoplite coordinates with the seller to ship a new item at no extra cost.

Shoplite also provides a **buyer protection guarantee**. If sellers fail to honor the return policy, Shoplite intervenes to process the refund directly, safeguarding the customer’s rights. Disputes are escalated to the support team, where resolution is typically reached within 10 business days.

By combining clear guidelines, easy-to-follow steps, and transparent timelines, Shoplite ensures customers feel confident when making purchases, knowing they have reliable recourse if something goes wrong.

## Document 7: Shoplite Product Reviews and Ratings

Product reviews and ratings on Shoplite are central to building trust between buyers and sellers. After completing a purchase, customers are invited to leave a **star rating (1–5)** along with written feedback about the product and seller experience. Reviews cover aspects such as product quality, delivery speed, accuracy of description, and overall satisfaction.

To ensure authenticity, only verified buyers who have completed a purchase can post reviews. The platform uses **anti-fraud measures** to detect suspicious activity, such as duplicate reviews or patterns of manipulation. Reviews that violate Shoplite’s community guidelines, including offensive language or irrelevant content, are removed by moderators.

Ratings contribute to a product’s overall visibility. Items with consistently high scores appear higher in search results and are often highlighted in recommendation sections. Sellers benefit from positive reviews, while repeated low ratings may trigger investigations into product quality or seller behavior. Shoplite provides sellers with a **response feature**, allowing them to address concerns publicly, clarify misunderstandings, or thank customers for feedback.

Customers browsing products can filter by rating levels, focusing on items with the best feedback. Detailed reviews with photos or videos are prioritized to help buyers make informed decisions. Review summaries display the percentage breakdown of ratings, offering a quick snapshot of customer sentiment.

By fostering transparency and accountability, Shoplite’s review system enhances buyer confidence and encourages sellers to maintain high standards. This cycle of feedback ensures the platform remains a trusted marketplace for both new and returning customers.

## Document 8: Shoplite Seller Account Setup and Management

Opening a seller account on Shoplite allows businesses to reach a large and diverse customer base. To get started, prospective sellers visit the **Shoplite Seller Registration Portal** and provide essential details such as business name, tax identification number, bank account information, and contact details. Supporting documents like business licenses may be required for verification. The approval process generally takes **2–3 business days**, after which sellers can begin listing products.

Once approved, sellers gain access to the **Seller Dashboard**, a centralized hub for managing all aspects of their business. From here, they can upload product listings with descriptions, pricing, and images. Bulk upload tools are available for large inventories, and each listing is subject to Shoplite’s quality guidelines to ensure accuracy and compliance.

Account management extends to **order processing**, where sellers can track incoming purchases, confirm shipments, and provide delivery updates. Automated notifications keep both sellers and buyers informed of order progress. Sellers can also manage returns, refunds, and disputes directly from their dashboard, with escalation options available if intervention is needed.

## Document 9: Shoplite Inventory Management for Sellers

Shoplite provides sellers with a comprehensive set of tools to manage their product inventory efficiently. Once registered, sellers can access the **Inventory Management module** within the Seller Dashboard. This system allows them to add new products individually or upload multiple listings in bulk using CSV templates. Each listing requires key details such as product name, description, category, price, quantity, and images that meet Shoplite’s quality standards.

The inventory module automatically tracks stock levels in real time. When a purchase is made, the system deducts the item from the available quantity, preventing overselling. Sellers receive notifications when stock reaches low thresholds, prompting them to restock before products run out. The system also allows sellers to set **minimum and maximum quantity limits** for purchases, ensuring better control over order flow.

For larger businesses, Shoplite offers **API integration**, enabling sellers to sync their external warehouse or ERP systems directly with the Shoplite platform. This reduces manual work and ensures consistent inventory accuracy across multiple channels. Inventory history logs are maintained, giving sellers visibility into past stock adjustments, order fulfillment, and restock timelines.

Sellers can categorize products, tag items for promotions, and schedule listings to go live at specific times. Inactive or out-of-stock items remain archived, allowing sellers to relist them quickly when inventory becomes available again. Analytical tools also provide insights into best-selling items, slow-moving products, and seasonal demand trends, enabling sellers to plan their inventory strategy effectively.

By combining automation, customization, and analytics, Shoplite’s inventory management system helps sellers reduce errors, save time, and optimize sales performance.

## Document 10: Shoplite Commission and Fee Structure

Shoplite operates on a transparent commission-based model that ensures both platform sustainability and seller profitability. Every completed sale is subject to a **commission fee**, which is calculated as a percentage of the item’s final sale price. The exact rate depends on the product category, with common rates ranging from **5% to 15%**. For example, electronics may carry a lower percentage, while fashion and accessories may have slightly higher fees.

In addition to commissions, sellers may encounter **service fees** for premium features such as promoted listings, priority search placement, or participation in special marketing campaigns. These fees are optional and clearly outlined before activation. Shoplite also charges a small **payment processing fee** to cover transaction costs, typically between **1%–3%**, depending on the payment gateway used.

To maintain transparency, sellers can access a detailed **Fee Breakdown Report** within their dashboard. This report itemizes commissions, service charges, and net earnings after deductions. Earnings are then transferred to the seller’s linked bank account on a regular payout schedule, usually every **7–14 days**, depending on the seller’s region and account type.

Shoplite ensures that sellers are never caught off guard by hidden costs. All fees are disclosed upfront during onboarding, and updates are communicated well in advance. Sellers can adjust their pricing strategy to accommodate commissions, ensuring they remain competitive while covering costs.

By offering clear guidelines and detailed reporting, Shoplite’s commission and fee structure builds trust with sellers, enabling them to focus on growing their business without uncertainty around earnings.

## Document 13: Shoplite API Documentation for Developers

The API is REST-based and designed with simplicity, scalability, and security in mind, enabling third-party developers to build solutions for tasks like product listing management, order processing, and account reporting.

To access the API, developers must first register for a **developer account** and obtain an API key. Authentication is handled through OAuth 2.0, ensuring secure communication between client applications and Shoplite’s servers.

Additionally, Shoplite complies with international standards such as **PCI-DSS for payment security** and **GDPR for data privacy**.

Customers’ personal information, including names, addresses, and payment details, is stored securely with access restricted to authorized personnel only.

## Document 15: Shoplite Promotional Codes and Discounts

Shoplite offers a variety of promotional codes and discount programs to enhance the shopping experience and drive sales for sellers. Promotional codes can be entered during checkout in the designated field, automatically applying eligible discounts to the order total. These codes may be distributed through Shoplite marketing campaigns, seller promotions, or loyalty rewards.

Types of discounts include **percentage-based discounts**, **fixed-amount reductions**, and **free shipping codes**. Some promotions are platform-wide, while others are tied to specific products, categories, or sellers. For example, a seller may create a 10% discount on all electronics for one week, while Shoplite may run seasonal sales events that apply to multiple categories.

Eligibility rules are clearly displayed with each code. Restrictions may include a minimum purchase amount, expiration date, or limitations on stacking multiple promotions. In many cases, only one promotional code can be applied per order, though platform-managed campaigns may allow combining discounts under special conditions.

To prevent misuse, Shoplite employs systems that monitor promo code activity. Abnormal patterns, such as repeated use of single-use codes or unauthorized code sharing, may result in the code being revoked or the account flagged for review. Sellers issuing their own promotions can track usage statistics through the Seller Dashboard, enabling them to measure campaign effectiveness.

The platform uses **machine learning models** to detect anomalies in transaction behavior, automatically flagging potential fraud for manual review by the security team.
